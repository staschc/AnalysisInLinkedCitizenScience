AnalysisInLinkedCitizenScience
==============================
This repository contains the envirocaR R-Package and some additional functions (aggregation functionality for Track objects and line-snapping algorithm to match trajectory coordinates to OSM street segments) that were implemented during the course "Analysis in Linked Citizen Science" at the Institute for Geoinformatics (ifgi.uni-muenster.de) in Münster. This course was a sequel to the EnviroCar study project (https://envirocar.org/) where we developed an open platform enableing citizen scientists to upload and share measurements from their car trips as Linked Open Data.
